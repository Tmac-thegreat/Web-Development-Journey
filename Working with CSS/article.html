 	  <p>What makes the powerful truly powerful? Is it a show of force or an abstinence from use of power? Power can be respected when exercised or not used, but true power is respected when exercised. While some might believe that respect does not necessarily come with the use of power, I believe that power can only truly be respected when used.</p>
 	  <p>It is often said that with great power comes great responsibility, but what exactly does this responsibility convey? Some would argue that responsibility would mean refraining from the use of power, like the stalemate between the United States and Russia during the cold war, but had a show of force been exercised, both countries would have been forced to come to the dialog table just as Japan did in 1945.</p>
 	  <p>Going back to the example of the atomic bomb, it was quite clear that all super powers during the time of the Second World War were in a race to develop the first atomic bomb. This was not just a show of scientific superiority, it was a show of military might and strength. Even after the development of the atomic bomb, the debate came whether it should be used or not. It was not until two bombs were dropped on the empire of Japan that they were forced to sue for peace. This is a perfect example of power being exercised and respected.</p>

 	  <p>Similarly, history recorded the rise of Spartacus, the Thracian slave who wreaked havoc all across the Italian peninsula. Spartacus and his band won battle after battle, freed more slaves and were on the verge of victory. Then Rome decided to send in the big boys, and the insurrection was brought to a halt. In a show of force, Rome decided to crucify all captured slaves about a meter from each other. As cruel as this might seem at the time, the strategy worked, as no such insurrection came up again in that generation. Rome could have punished the slaves, or cut off an arm, but the show of force made all slaves comply with the rule at that time.</p>
 	  <p>One could also point to the story of Neville Chamberlain and Adolf Hitler as a point were power should have been use but instead, was not. It ultimately emboldened Hitler and like we all know, all calls for Germany to withdraw from Poland was ignored.</p>
 	  <p>Ultimately, as seen from various evidences provided, power is only truly respected when exercised. The story of the atomic bomb, Spartacus showed how power was respected when exercised, and Neville Chamberlain showed how power was not exercised and ultimately disrespected.</p>
